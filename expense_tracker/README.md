# 💸 Python Expense Tracker 💸

A simple and interactive **Python Expense Tracker** that helps you record, view, and manage your daily spending!
All your expenses are automatically saved in a JSON file so your data is always safe.

---

## Description

This program allows you to:

* Add new expenses with a **category**, **description**, and **amount**
* View all recorded expenses in a clean, readable list
* See **total spending per category**
* See your **overall total spending**
* Remove expenses by selecting their number
* Automatically save and load data using a **JSON file**

It’s a great beginner-friendly project for practicing **file handling**, **JSON**, **lists & dictionaries**, **functions**, and **user input validation** in Python.

# Palindrome Checker

A simple Python program that checks whether a given word or phrase is a palindrome — meaning it reads the same backward as forward.

##  Features

* Accepts user input for any word or phrase.
* Automatically ignores leading/trailing spaces and capitalization.
* Returns `True` if the input is a palindrome, and `False` otherwise.
* Prompts the user until a valid input is entered.

## 🧩 Example

```text
Enter a word or phrase to check if is palindrome: Madam
True
```

```text
Enter a word or phrase to check if is palindrome: hello
False
```

# Simple Python Calculator 🪙
A beginner-friendly Python command-line calculator!
Perform quick math operations right from your terminal — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division made simple.

## ✨ Features
* Clean and interactive command-line interface with emoji styling.
* Supports the four basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
* Handles division by zero gracefully with clear error messages.
* **Loop functionality** — perform multiple calculations without restarting!
* **Function-based design** for clean, reusable code.
* Perfect for Python beginners learning input, conditionals, functions, and loops.

## 📝 Example
```text
🪙 Simple Python Calculator🪙

Enter the first number: 10
Choose the operator (*,+,-,/): /
Enter the second number: 2

10.0 / 2.0 = 5.0

Calculate again? (yes/no): yes
Enter the first number: 15
Choose the operator (*,+,-,/): +
Enter the second number: 5

15.0 + 5.0 = 20.0

Calculate again? (yes/no): no
Thanks for using the calculator! Goodbye! 🪙
```

If you try dividing by zero:
```text
Enter the first number: 7
Choose the operator (*,+,-,/): /
Enter the second number: 0

7.0 / 0.0 = Error: division by zero!
```

If you enter an invalid operator:
```text
Enter the first number: 5
Choose the operator (*,+,-,/): %
Enter the second number: 3

5.0 % 3.0 = Error: Invalid operator!
```

## 🚀 Challenge Yourself!
Think you've mastered this version? Try upgrading it with your own ideas!
Here are some suggestions:
* ✅ ~~Allow the user to perform **multiple calculations** without restarting the program.~~ (Already implemented!)
* ✅ ~~Build a **function-based version** for cleaner, reusable code.~~ (Already implemented!)
* 🔧 Add **error handling** for invalid inputs (like letters instead of numbers using try-except).
* ➕ Add **new operations** — modulus `%`, power `**`, or square root.
* 💾 Add a **calculation history** feature to view previous calculations.
* 🎨 Create a **GUI version** using tkinter or a web interface using Flask.

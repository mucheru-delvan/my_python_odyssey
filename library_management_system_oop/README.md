#  Python Library Management System 

A simple and interactive **Python Library Management System** that allows you to manage books, users, and borrowing operations using clean Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

This project uses three classes — **Book**, **User**, and **Library** — to simulate a small library environment.

---

## Description

This program allows you to:

* Add multiple **books** to the library
* Register **users**
* Borrow books using a **user ID**
* Return borrowed books
* View all books stored in the library
* View all registered users
* See which books a user has borrowed
* Practice **OOP**, **classes**, **objects**, and **modular code structure** in Python

It’s a great beginner-friendly project for understanding **encapsulation**, **class interaction**, and **real-world system modeling**.

##  Example Usage

### Initializing the system

```text
📚Welcome to the Library Management System📚

Books successfully added!
Users registered!
```

---

### Borrowing a book

```text
User U002 is borrowing: The Great Gatsby
Book borrowed successfully!
```

---

### Returning a book

```text
User U002 is returning: The Great Gatsby
Book returned successfully!
```

---

### Viewing all books

```text
  All Library Books 
1. 1984 - George Orwell
2. To Kill a Mockingbird - Harper Lee
3. The Great Gatsby - F. Scott Fitzgerald
...
```

---

### Viewing all users

```text
 Registered Users 
1. Alice (U001)
2. Melvin (U002)
3. Charlie (U003)
...
```

---

### Viewing a user's borrowed books

```text
📖 Books borrowed by Alice:
1. 1984
2. The Hobbit
3. Moby Dick
```

---

### When a user is not registered

```text
User with ID U010 not found!
```

## Technologies & Concepts Used

* Python Classes & Objects
* Object-Oriented Programming
* Lists & basic data structures
* Clean modular code organization
* Simulated real-world library system

---

##  Running the Program

Make sure all `.py` files (`book.py`, `user.py`, `library_management.py`, `main.py`) are in the same folder.

Run the program using:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

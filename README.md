#  My Python Odyssey

Hi there 👋, welcome to my Python journey!
This repo is where I drop all the code I write while **learning, experimenting, and building mini-projects**. Think of it like a growing collection of scripts and small apps — some polished, some messy, all part of the adventure.

---

## 🌱 Why I Started This

I wanted a place to:

* Track my growth as I learn Python
* Store the random scripts and projects I build
* Look back one day and laugh at my early code 😅

---

## 📂 What You’ll Find

* 📝 **Practice scripts** → small exercises to sharpen my skills
* ⚡ **Mini-projects** → fun experiments, from useful tools to random ideas
* 🐛 **Bugs & fixes** → because mistakes are part of the journey
* 🚀 **Wins** → moments where I finally got something to work 🎉

---

## 🛠 Tools I Use

* Python 3.x
* VS Code
* Git + GitHub
* …and lots of coffee ☕

---

## 🚀 How to Try Things Out

Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mucheru-delvan/my_python_odyssey.git
cd my_python_odyssey
```

Run a script:

```bash
python3 script_name.py
```

Some projects may have their own README with extra instructions.

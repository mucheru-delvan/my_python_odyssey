Hi there 👋, welcome to my Python journey!
This repository contains my beginner-friendly Python projects, API integrations, and problems I've solved through code.
Each project is a step forward in mastering Python, problem-solving, and backend development.

## 🌱 Why I Created This
I built this repo to:
- 🧩 Document my Python learning journey  
- ⚙️ Solve real problems with hands-on code  
- 🌐 Explore APIs and backend concepts  
- 💡 Showcase my progress as a growing developer  
---
## 📂 What You'll Find
- 🧠 **Beginner Projects** → foundational exercises and small applications  
- 🤖 **API Integrations** → working with real-world data and REST APIs  
- 🔧 **Utility Tools** → automation and everyday scripts  
- 🎮 **Interactive Apps** → engaging CLI-based projects  
- 🧮 **Problem Solutions** → coding challenges and logical problem solving

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Python 3.x**
* **VS Code**
* **Git + GitHub**
* Built-in Python libraries (`json`, `statistics`, `pathlib`, etc.)
* …and lots of coffee ☕

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **1. Clone this repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mucheru-delvan/my_python_odyssey.git
cd my_python_odyssey
```

---

### **2. Navigate to a project folder**

Each project is in its own directory.

Example:

```bash
cd student_gradebook_app
```

or:

```bash
cd expense_tracker
```

---

### **3. Run the project file**

Projects in this repo are named individually (e.g., `student_gradebook.py`, `expense_tracker.py`) — not `main.py`.

Run the file inside the folder:

```bash
python3 student_gradebook.py
```

or:

```bash
python3 expense_tracker.py
```

(Windows users can use `python` instead of `python3`.)


---

## 🏁 Using `main.py` in OOP Projects

Some projects in this repository are built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.
In these projects, the program is divided into multiple Python files for better organization, and `main.py` serves as the **entry point**.

### **Why `main.py`?**

* Keeps your **classes** and **logic** in separate files (e.g., `student.py`, `gradebook.py`)
* Allows you to **run the program from one place**
* Makes the project **modular, reusable, and professional**

---

### **How to Run OOP Projects**

1. Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd student_gradebook_oop
```

2. Run the `main.py` file:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

*(Windows users can use `python main.py`)*


---

### **4. Check the project's README**

Every project directory includes its own README explaining:

* 📝 Project overview
* ⚙️ Requirements
* ▶️ How to run it
* ✨ Features
* 📌 Example output
